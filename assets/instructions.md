####Objective

####Gameplay
One player will selected 4 cards on the board.  The other player will then pick 4 cards and be told some information about how close they are to picking the correct cards.  For instance they could be told if the card they selected matches the other card's color, suit, or value.  Player will get 10 tries to match all 4 cards. If both players discover all 4 cards, the player who took the fewest turns is the winner.  If both players took the same number of turns the game is a tie.
