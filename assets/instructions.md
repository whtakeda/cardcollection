####Objective
Find as many matches (pairs) as you can.

####Gameplay
Player clicks two cards.  If they match, player gets 1 point and continues.  If they do not match, the other player gets a turn.

####Miscellaneous
Because there are an even number of pairs in some difficulty levels, the winner is the first person to get at least half the maximum possible number of pairs.  The game ends immediately once a player wins, even if the board is not cleared.

There will be 3 difficulty levels: easy, normal, and hard.

Easy will allow a player to match any 2 cards by value.

Normal will require the player to match 2 cards matching both value and color.

Hard will require the player to match all 4 cards of the same value.
