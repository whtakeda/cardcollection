# Card Collection

This is the readme.md file for my first project, Card Collection

## User Stories

### MVP (Ongoing)
* As a player the game should be winnable, because the Kobayashi Maru and cat's games are no fun
  * Well-defined goal/outcome
* person-entertained-enjoyable
* As a player, the game interface should be visual and interactive, because Zork is so 1980s
  * Graphical user interface
  * Use images and animation where appropriate
* As a player, I want the controls to be simple/easy-to-use
  * mouse controllable

### MVP (Completed)

### Icebox

* As a player, the game should be easy to learn, because nobody wants to read the instructions
  * Simple rules
  * Instructions (just in case)
* As a player, the game should have replay value and be challenging, so I have a good way to waste my free time
  * Multiple difficulty levels and/or multiple winning objectives, and/or multiple games
